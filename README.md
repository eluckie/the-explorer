# The Explorer

#### By E. Luckie ☀️

#### This application was made as a front-end that consumes information from [this API](https://github.com/eluckie/ParksApi.Solution.git) about National & State Parks. Users are able to see a list of all parks, as well as add parks, edit, or delete parks.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

### To Install and Run The API
1. First, [go here](https://github.com/eluckie/ParksApi.Solution.git) and follow all directions in the README to get the API up and running
2. Once the API is running in either development or production mode, follow the below instructions to install and run this project

### To Install and Run This Project

1. Clone this repository to your desktop
2. Navigate to the top level of this directory called ``the-explorer``
3. Run the code ``npm install`` in your terminal to install the necessary packages and plug-ins
4. Run the code ``npm run start`` in your terminal to start the application and open the project in your web browser

**NOTE:** both the Parks API _and_ this React project must be actively running in order to function properly. If something is not working, revisit the set up instructions for both projects

## Known Bugs

* can still continue to view pages past where there is data

## Stretch Plans

* Add a ``RANDOM`` endpoint that randomly returns a park.
* Add a second custom endpoint that accepts parameters. Example: a ``SEARCH`` route that allows users to search by specific park names.
